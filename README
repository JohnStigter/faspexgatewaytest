This repository is to demonstrate the problem with using the aspera HTTP Gateway SDK in combination with a NodeJS application.
It seems that the @ibm-aspera/http-gateway-sdk-js is meant to work in the browser.

As of nodejs v18 and higher the fetch part works ok, versions prior to this needs a fix in the @ibm-aspera/http-gateway-sdk-js package where you incluse a const fetch = require('node-fetch'); line at the beginning of the helper file http.js. This needs to be done in combination with node-fetch@2 in the nodejs application running on a node version < v18. Anyway, the package can be compiled when using NodeJS V18 and higher.

Initializing the http-gateway works, but when uploading a file, the package requires a document context.

Use this package as follows.
-clone the package on a system with node JS v18 or higher installed
-npm install on the package
-enter a valid value in index.js for the following variables:
    FASPEX_GATEWAY_HOST
    FASPEX_HOST
    BEARER_TOKEN
-run the following to see that the gateway is succesfully initialized but fails at the upload stage.
npm run test.
